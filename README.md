## Overview

The notebook implements the following steps for text classification:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data, including stopwords removal and tokenization.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text into numerical features using methods like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
3. **Model Training**: Training models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction**: Classifying unseen data with the trained model.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the notebook:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key files:

- `text_classification.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the full code and implementation of the text classification pipeline.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to set up, and usage details.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `text_classification.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook text_classification.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the cells in sequence to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

3. Modify the data or models as needed to experiment with different configurations.

## Example Output

Here is an example of the output from the classification model:

- **Accuracy**: 0.85
- **Precision**: 0.84
- **Recall**: 0.83
- **F1-score**: 0.84

You can visualize the model performance using confusion matrices, classification reports, and more.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the notebook as per your needs:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Modify the stopwords, tokenization method, or text cleaning process.
- **Models**: Experiment with different machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or XGBoost.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use other feature extraction methods like Word2Vec, BERT embeddings, or custom feature engineering.
